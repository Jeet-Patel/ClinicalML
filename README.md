# ClinicalML: Machine Learning for ICU Outcome Prediction

ClinicalML is a machine learning pipeline designed to predict critical ICU patient outcomes‚Äîmortality and length of stay (LoS)‚Äîusing clinical admission notes from the MIMIC-III dataset. By leveraging Named Entity Recognition (NER), clustering, and traditional ML models, this project demonstrates that lightweight ML approaches can achieve comparable results to transformer-based models while maintaining explainability for clinicians.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Clinical Outcome Prediction**: Predicts mortality and length of stay using textual data from admission notes.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts disease and medication entities using NER (Med7, HunFlair) and applies K-Means clustering on BioClinicalBERT embeddings.
- **ML Models**: Implements traditional models (XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) achieving **0.58 F1-score for mortality** and **0.33 F1-score for LoS**.
- **Explainability**: Focuses on interpretable ML models to support clinician decision-making.

## üìä Dataset
- **MIMIC-III v1.4**: A publicly available dataset of de-identified ICU patient records from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
- The dataset requires credentialed access via [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/).

## üìå Results
- **Mortality Prediction (XGBoost, Disease-based Features)**: **0.58 F1-score**
- **Length of Stay Prediction (XGBoost, Disease-based Features)**: **0.33 F1-score**
- Traditional ML models provide competitive performance against transformer-based models while being more interpretable.
